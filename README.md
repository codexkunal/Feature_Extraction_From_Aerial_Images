# Aerial Image Object Detection using YOLO

This project implements a deep learning model to classify objects in aerial images, such as windmills, airplanes, highways, and more. The model is based on the YOLO architecture from Ultralytics and can detect around 20 different object classes. This project provides an interface for users to upload aerial images and get predictions on the objects detected.




## Features

- Object Detection in Aerial Images: Detects and classifies objects such as windmills, airplanes, and other structures from user-uploaded aerial images.
- 20 Classes Detection: Capable of detecting up to 20 different objects in aerial images.
- User-friendly Interface: Simple interface for uploading images and receiving object detection results
- YOLO-based Model: Utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLO model for real-time object detection.
